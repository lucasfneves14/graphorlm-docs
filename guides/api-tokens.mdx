---

This guide explains how to create, manage, and use API tokens to securely connect external applications and AI assistants to your Graphor flows.

## Overview

API tokens provide secure authentication for programmatic access to your Graphor projects and flows. They are essential for:

- Connecting applications to your RAG pipelines via REST API
- Integrating with AI assistants through MCP Server
- Automating processes with Graphor resources
- Building custom integrations with your existing tools

## Creating API Tokens

To create a new API token:

1. Navigate to your project in Graphor
2. Click on **API Tokens** in the left sidebar
3. Click the **Create New Token** button
4. Enter a descriptive name for your token (e.g., "Production REST API" or "Claude Integration")
5. Click **Create**
6. **Important**: Copy your token immediately and store it securely. For security reasons, the full token will only be displayed once.

## Managing Tokens

The API Tokens page provides several management capabilities:

### Revoking Tokens

To revoke a token that is no longer needed or may be compromised:

1. Navigate to the API Tokens page
2. Find the token you want to revoke
3. Click the **Delete** icon next to the token
4. Confirm the revocation

Once revoked, a token cannot be restored. Any services using the token will immediately lose access to your Graphor resources.

## Token Security Best Practices

API tokens provide access to your Graphor resources, so it's important to handle them securely:

### Storage

- Never store tokens in public repositories or client-side code
- Use environment variables or secure secret management systems
- For development environments, consider using .env files (excluded from version control)

### Distribution

- Share tokens securely with team members who need access
- Use encrypted channels for token distribution

### Rotation

- Regularly rotate tokens used in production systems
- Immediately revoke tokens when team members leave or roles change
- Create new tokens rather than sharing existing ones for new integrations
