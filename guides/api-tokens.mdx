---

This guide explains how to create, manage, and use API tokens to securely connect external applications and AI assistants to your Graphor flows.

## Overview

API tokens provide secure authentication for programmatic access to your Graphor projects and flows. They are essential for:

- Connecting applications to your RAG pipelines via REST API
- Integrating with AI assistants through MCP Server
- Automating processes with Graphor resources
- Building custom integrations with your existing tools

## Creating API Tokens

To create a new API token:

1. Navigate to your project in Graphor
2. Click on **API Tokens** in the left sidebar
3. Click the **Create New Token** button
4. Enter a descriptive name for your token (e.g., "Production REST API" or "Claude Integration")
5. Click **Create**
6. **Important**: Copy your token immediately and store it securely. For security reasons, the full token will only be displayed once.

## Managing Tokens

The API Tokens page provides several management capabilities:

### Revoking Tokens

To revoke a token that is no longer needed or may be compromised:

1. Navigate to the API Tokens page
2. Find the token you want to revoke
3. Click the **Delete** icon next to the token
4. Confirm the revocation

Once revoked, a token cannot be restored. Any services using the token will immediately lose access to your Graphor resources.

## Using API Tokens

API tokens are used in different ways depending on your integration method:

### REST API

For REST API integrations, include your token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```javascript
fetch("https://{flow_name}.flows.graphorlm.com", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "your search query"
  })
})
```

### MCP Server

For MCP Server integrations, include your token in the environment configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-mcp-server-name": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--refresh",
        "mcp-proxy",
        "https://{flow_name}.flows.graphorlm.com/mcp/sse"
      ],
      "env": {
        "API_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_API_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Token Security Best Practices

API tokens provide access to your Graphor resources, so it's important to handle them securely:

### Storage

- Never store tokens in public repositories or client-side code
- Use environment variables or secure secret management systems
- For development environments, consider using .env files (excluded from version control)

### Distribution

- Share tokens securely with team members who need access
- Use encrypted channels for token distribution

### Rotation

- Regularly rotate tokens used in production systems
- Immediately revoke tokens when team members leave or roles change
- Create new tokens rather than sharing existing ones for new integrations

## Troubleshooting Token Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Authentication failures">
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify you're using the full token string
    - Check that the token hasn't been revoked
    - Confirm you're using the correct Authorization format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="arrow-right-to-bracket" title="Access denied errors">
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify the token is assigned to the correct project
    - Ensure the resources you're accessing exist
    - Create a new token with appropriate permissions if needed

    **Solutions**:
    - Immediately revoke any potentially compromised tokens
    - Create new tokens with fresh credentials
    - Update security practices for token storage
