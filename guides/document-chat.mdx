Graphor's Document Chat lets you have natural conversations with your documents. Ask questions in plain language and receive answers grounded in your actual content — with full conversational memory to maintain context across multiple questions.

## Overview

Document Chat enables you to:

- **Ask questions naturally** — No query syntax needed, just ask like you would ask a colleague
- **Get grounded answers** — Responses are based on your actual document content
- **Maintain conversation context** — Follow-up questions understand previous context
- **Scope to specific documents** — Focus on one document or search across all sources

<Note>
Document Chat uses the **active parsing version** of each document. The quality of answers directly depends on how well your documents were parsed. For better results, adjust the parsing settings and use advanced methods like **VLM** or **Agentic** for complex documents. See [Data Ingestion](/guides/data-ingestion#document-parsing-methods) for details.

## Chat Options

Graphor provides two chat interfaces depending on your needs:

### Chat with All Sources

Access the global chat from the **Sources** page by clicking the **Chat** button in the top-right corner.

This mode searches across **all ingested documents** in your project, making it ideal for:

- Finding information when you don't know which document contains it
- Comparing information across multiple sources
- Getting a comprehensive view of your entire knowledge base
- Answering questions that span multiple documents

### Chat with a Specific Document

Access the focused chat from the **Source details** page (double-click on any source) by clicking the **Chat** button in the top-right corner.

This mode searches only within **the selected document**, making it ideal for:

- Deep-diving into a specific document's content
- Avoiding noise from other sources
- Getting precise answers from a known document
- Analyzing a single file in detail

## How to Use Document Chat

### Starting a Conversation

1. Navigate to **Sources** (for all documents) or double-click a specific source (for single document)
2. Click the **Chat** button in the top-right corner
3. Type your question in the chat input
4. Press Enter or click Send

### Asking Effective Questions

Document Chat works best with clear, specific questions:

**Good questions:**
- "What are the main findings in the Q3 financial report?"
- "Summarize the key terms of the service agreement"
- "What products are mentioned and what are their prices?"
- "Who are the parties involved in this contract?"

**Questions that could be improved:**
- "Tell me everything" → Too broad, be more specific
- "What?" → Provide context about what you're looking for
- "Info" → Ask a complete question

### Following Up

Document Chat maintains **conversational memory**, so you can ask follow-up questions without repeating context:

> **You:** What products are mentioned in the catalog?
> 
> **Chat:** The catalog mentions three products: Product A ($199), Product B ($299), and Product C ($149)...
> 
> **You:** Which one is the most expensive?
> 
> **Chat:** Based on the catalog, Product B is the most expensive at $299...
> 
> **You:** What features does it have?
> 
> **Chat:** Product B includes the following features: ...

### Starting Fresh

To start a new conversation without previous context, click the **Clear** button.

## Use Cases

### Research & Analysis

- "What methodology was used in this study?"
- "Summarize the literature review section"
- "What are the limitations mentioned by the authors?"

### Document Review

- "What are the key obligations in this contract?"
- "When does the agreement expire?"
- "What are the payment terms?"

### Knowledge Discovery

- "What topics are covered in these documents?"
- "Find all mentions of [specific term]"
- "What recommendations are made?"

### Quick Lookups

- "What is the contact information listed?"
- "What is the total amount on this invoice?"
- "When was this document created?"

## Best Practices

### For Better Answers

1. **Be specific** — The more specific your question, the more precise the answer
2. **Provide context** — If asking about something specific, mention what you're looking for
3. **Use follow-ups** — Build on previous answers rather than asking unrelated questions
4. **Ask one thing at a time** — Complex questions with multiple parts may get partial answers

### Choosing the Right Scope

| Use All Sources When... | Use Specific Document When... |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| You don't know which document has the answer | You know exactly which document to search |
| You want to compare across documents | You want focused, precise answers |
| You're exploring your knowledge base | You're analyzing a specific file |
| Questions span multiple topics/files | Questions are about one document's content |

### Parsing Quality Matters

Document Chat uses the **active parsing version** of each document to generate answers. The quality of responses directly depends on the parsing quality.

**Recommended parsing methods by document type:**

| Document Type | Recommended Method |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Simple text documents | Fast |
| Complex layouts | VLM or Agentic |
| Scanned documents / PDFs with images | Balanced or Accurate |
| Manuscripts / Handwritten | VLM |
| Multi-page tables, diagrams | Agentic |

**If you're getting poor answers:**

1. Double-click the document to open Source details
2. Go to the **Settings** tab
3. Select a more advanced parsing method
4. Click **Parse** and wait for processing

The chat will automatically use the new active version for future questions. See [Data Ingestion](/guides/data-ingestion#document-parsing-methods) for detailed parsing method comparisons.

## API Integration

Document Chat is available via the REST API:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://sources.graphorlm.com/ask-sources" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What are the main findings in this report?",
    "conversation_id": null,
    "reset": false,
    "file_names": null
  }'
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `question` | string | Your question in natural language |
| `conversation_id` | string (optional) | ID to continue a previous conversation |
| `reset` | boolean | Set to `true` to start a fresh conversation |
| `file_names` | string[] (optional) | Restrict search to specific documents |

### Response

```json
{
  "answer": "The main findings indicate that...",
  "conversation_id": "conv_abc123"
}
```

Use the returned `conversation_id` in subsequent requests to maintain conversation context.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-question" title="Getting irrelevant answers">
    If answers don't match your questions:
    - Be more specific in your question
    - Use the single-document chat if you know which file has the answer
    - Check that documents are properly parsed
    - Try rephrasing your question
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="file-circle-xmark" title="Document content not found">
    If the chat can't find information you know exists:
    - Verify the document status is "Processed"
    - Check the active parsing version has the content
    - Try a different parsing method for better extraction
    - Ensure the content isn't in images (may need OCR)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Slow responses">
    Response time depends on:
    - Number of documents being searched
    - Document size and complexity
    - Question complexity
    
    For faster responses, use single-document chat when possible.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="comments" title="Lost conversation context">
    If the chat seems to forget previous context:
    - Don't refresh the page mid-conversation
    - Use the same chat session for related questions
    - The API requires passing `conversation_id` to maintain context
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
