## Overview

After building and optimizing your RAG pipeline, the final step is integrating it with your applications or AI assistants. Graphor offers two primary integration methods:

1. **REST API** - Direct HTTP endpoint integration for custom applications
2. **MCP Server** - [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) integration for AI assistants like Claude and Cursor

Each method provides different capabilities and is suitable for different use cases.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating your Graphor workflow, ensure you have:

- A fully configured and tested RAG pipeline in Graphor
- A deployed flow revision with 100% traffic allocation
- API tokens for authentication (generated in the API Tokens section)

## Integration Methods

### REST API Integration

The REST API provides a simple HTTP endpoint that allows applications to send queries and receive structured responses from your RAG pipeline.

#### Endpoint

When you deploy a flow, a unique endpoint URL is created. You can find this URL by:

1. Opening your flow in the Flow Builder
2. Clicking the **Connect to flow** button
3. Selecting the **REST API** tab

The endpoint follows this format:
```
https://{flow_name}.flows.graphorlm.com
```

#### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using a Bearer token:

1. Navigate to the **API Tokens** section in your project
2. Click **Create New Token**
3. Name your token and set appropriate permissions
4. Copy the generated token (Note: It will only be shown once)
5. Include the token in the `Authorization` header of your requests as `Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN`

#### Request Format

Send a POST request with a JSON body containing the following optional parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `query` | string | The search query for your RAG pipeline |
| `page` | number | The page number for pagination (default: 1) |
| `page_size` | number | Number of items per page (default: None) |

#### Example Request

```javascript
// POST request to https://{flow_name}.flows.graphorlm.com
// Headers must include a Bearer token for authentication

fetch("https://{flow_name}.flows.graphorlm.com", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "your search query",  // Optional
    page: 1,                     // Optional, default: 1
    page_size: 10                // Optional, default: None
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```

#### Response Format

The API returns a JSON object with the following structure:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `items` | array | Documents matching your query |
| `total` | number | Total number of matching documents |
| `page` | number | Current page number |
| `page_size` | number | Number of items per page |
| `total_pages` | number | Total number of pages |

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "doc-123",
      "page_content": "Document content text...",
      "metadata": {
        // Additional document metadata
      },
      "type": "Document"
    },
    // More documents...
  ],
  "total": 42,
  "page": 1,
  "page_size": 10,
  "total_pages": 5
}
```

### MCP Server Integration

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server integration allows AI assistants like Claude and Cursor to directly utilize your RAG pipeline as a tool, enabling more natural and powerful interactions.

#### Finding Your MCP Endpoint

To locate your flow's MCP endpoint:

1. Open your flow in the Flow Builder
2. Click the **Connect to flow** button in the top right corner
3. Select the **MCP Server** tab
4. You'll see the complete MCP endpoint URL in the following format:
   ```
   https://{flow_name}.flows.graphorlm.com/mcp/sse
   ```
5. This is the URL you'll need to configure in your MCP client

The flow name in the URL corresponds to the name you gave your flow when you created it or its automatically generated identifier.

#### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open specification for connecting language models to external tools and data sources. It allows AI assistants to:

- Access your RAG pipeline's knowledge base
- Use the retrieved information to generate better responses
- Maintain context across interactions
- Dynamically fetch relevant information based on the conversation

#### Tool Description Importance

When deploying your flow for MCP Server integration, providing a detailed tool description is critical. This helps AI assistants understand:

- When to use your RAG pipeline
- What kind of queries it can handle
- What information it contains
- Any limitations or special considerations

A good tool description ensures more accurate and relevant use of your RAG pipeline by AI assistants.

#### Example Tool Description

```
This tool retrieves information from AI research papers based on user queries.

Purpose: Find relevant content from scientific articles on artificial intelligence topics.

Input: Natural language questions or keywords about AI research.

Output: Text passages from academic papers.

Capabilities:
- Finds specific AI methodologies and techniques
- Retrieves state-of-the-art results
- Provides explanations of AI concepts from academic sources

Limitations:
- Papers published before June 2023 only
- English-language publications only
- Text only, no images or tables

Example queries:
"Latest advances in transformer models"
"Compare LSTM and GRU performance"
"Techniques to reduce hallucinations in LLMs"
```

## Setting Up MCP Server Integration

Follow these steps to connect your RAG pipeline to AI assistants using MCP:

### Step 1: Install UV Library

Install the UV library using the appropriate command for your operating system:

- **macOS**: `brew install uv`
- **Linux**: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- **Windows**: `winget install uv`

### Step 2: Obtain an API Token

Create an API token from the **API Tokens** page in your Graphor project.

### Step 3: Configure MCP Server Connection

#### For Claude Desktop

1. Find or create the Claude Desktop config file at:
   - **macOS/Linux**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the following configuration to the file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-flow-name": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--refresh",
        "mcp-proxy",
        "https://{flow_name}.flows.graphorlm.com/mcp/sse"
      ],
      "env": {
        "API_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_API_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Replace `your-flow-name` with a unique name for MCP server and `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with your API token.

4. Restart Claude Desktop.

#### For Cursor

1. Go to Settings â†’ Cursor Settings
2. Navigate to the MCP tab
3. Click on "Add new global MCP server"
4. This will open the Cursor MCP configuration file (mcp.json)
5. Add the following configuration to the file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-flow-name": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--refresh",
        "mcp-proxy",
        "https://{flow_name}.flows.graphorlm.com/mcp/sse"
      ],
      "env": {
        "API_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_API_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

6. Replace `your-flow-name` with a unique name for your MCP server and `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with your API token.

### Step 4: Using MCP in Cursor Chat

To use your MCP flow in Cursor's chat:

1. Open a chat in Cursor
2. Click on the mode menu (usually shows "Manual" by default)
3. Select "Agent" from the dropdown menu
4. Your configured MCP flow will now be available for use in the chat

## Integration Best Practices

### REST API

- **Cache responses**: Implement caching to reduce API calls for common queries
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling for API failures
- **Monitor usage**: Keep track of API usage to optimize performance
- **Implement rate limiting**: Protect your endpoints from excessive requests

### MCP Server

- **Create detailed tool descriptions**: Be specific and comprehensive to help AI assistants use your tool effectively
- **Update tool descriptions**: Refine descriptions based on observed usage patterns
- **Test different queries**: Verify that a wide range of query types work as expected
- **Provide examples**: Include sample queries in your tool description
