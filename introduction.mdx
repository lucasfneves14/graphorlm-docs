## Unstructured Data into Intelligent Insights

Graphor empowers organizations to unlock the full potential of their unstructured data through state-of-the-art document parsing, intelligent data extraction, and advanced RAG pipelines. Our platform bridges the gap between raw information and actionable knowledge, enabling you to build powerful AI applications with precision and ease.

## Data Ingestion

Graphor applies **state-of-the-art parsing** to your documents, combining advanced OCR capabilities with intelligent text classification to transform unstructured content into structured, queryable formats.

### Supported File Formats

| Category | Formats |
|----------|---------|
| **Documents** | PDF, DOC, DOCX, ODT, PPT, PPTX, HTML, TXT |
| **Tabular** | CSV, TSV, XLS, XLSX |
| **Images** | PNG, JPG, JPEG, TIFF, BMP, HEIC |
| **Video** | MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM |
| **Audio** | MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, FLAC |
| **Markdown** | MD |

### Multi-Source Ingestion

Beyond local file uploads, Graphor supports ingestion from multiple sources:

- **Web Scraping** - Ingest content directly from URLs with optional crawling to capture linked pages
- **GitHub Repositories** - Automatically process code and documentation from GitHub repos
- **YouTube Videos** - Extract and process transcripts from YouTube videos

## Data Extraction

Transform your documents into structured data with **LLM-powered extraction**. Define custom output schemas and provide natural language instructions to extract exactly the information you need.

- **Custom Schema Definition** - Define output fields with types (string, number, boolean, array) and descriptions
- **Natural Language Instructions** - Guide the extraction process with custom prompts
- **Page-Level Provenance** - Each extracted item includes references to source pages for full traceability

## Document Chat

**Chat with your documents** using natural language. Ask questions and get answers grounded in your ingested content.

- **Conversational Memory** - Maintain context across multiple questions in the same conversation
- **Document Scoping** - Focus your questions on a specific document or search across all sources
- **Contextual Answers** - Responses are grounded in your actual document content
