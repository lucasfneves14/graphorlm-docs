This quickstart gets you up and running with Graphor as quickly as possible. You'll learn how to ingest documents from multiple sources, extract structured data, and chat with your documents — all without diving into complex configurations.

In this tutorial, you will:
- Ingest data from local files, URLs, GitHub, and YouTube
- Parse and process your documents with state-of-the-art OCR
- Extract structured data using LLM-powered extraction
- Chat with your documents using natural language

## Step 1: Set up Your Project

Graphor Cloud provides a fully-managed environment where you can ingest, process, and interact with your data without worrying about infrastructure.

1. Sign up for a [Graphor Cloud account](https://app.graphorlm.com/register)
2. Login to your account at [Login](https://app.graphorlm.com/login)
3. Once logged in, you'll see the Graphor dashboard
4. Click **New project** and give it a descriptive name

Once your project is created, you'll be taken to the Sources dashboard where you can begin ingesting your data.

## Step 2: Ingest Your Data

Graphor supports ingesting data from multiple sources. Navigate to **Sources** in the left sidebar to get started.

### Upload Local Files

Upload documents directly from your computer. You have two options:

**Option 1: Drag and drop directly**
- Simply drag and drop your files anywhere on the Sources page

**Option 2: Use the upload interface**
1. Click **Add** to open the upload interface
2. Select **Local files**
3. Select your files or drag and drop them into the upload area

  className="block border rounded-2xl border-gray-950\/10 ring-2 ring-transparent"
  src="/images/local-files-upload.png"
  alt="Local files upload"
  loading="lazy"
/>

**Supported formats include:**

| Category | Formats |
|----------|---------|
| **Documents** | PDF, DOC, DOCX, ODT, PPT, PPTX, HTML, TXT |
| **Tabular** | CSV, TSV, XLS, XLSX |
| **Images** | PNG, JPG, JPEG, TIFF, BMP, HEIC |
| **Video** | MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM |
| **Audio** | MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, FLAC |
| **Markdown** | MD |

### Import from URL

Ingest content directly from web pages:

1. Click **Add** and select **Web page**
2. Enter the web address you want to ingest
3. Optionally enable **Crawl URLs** to capture linked pages
4. Click **Finish** to start processing

This is perfect for ingesting documentation sites, blog posts, or any public web content.

### Import GitHub Repository

Process code and documentation from GitHub:

1. Click **Add Sources** and select **GitHub**
2. Enter the repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo`)
3. Click **Finish** to begin ingestion

Graphor will automatically process README files, documentation, and code files from the repository.

### Import YouTube Video

Extract and process transcripts from YouTube:

1. Click **Add** and select **YouTube**
2. Paste the YouTube video URL
3. Click **Finish** to extract the transcript

This allows you to make video content searchable and queryable.

After adding sources, you can monitor the ingestion progress on the Sources dashboard. Each source shows its current status: **Waiting**, **Uploading**, **Processing**, **Processed**, **Not parsed**, or **Failed**.

## Step 3: Parse & Process Documents

When you upload a source, Graphor automatically applies the **Fast** parsing method — optimized for speed with heuristic classification for text documents, transcription for videos/audio, and fast scraping for web pages.

For more complex documents, you can manually apply advanced parsing methods:

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Fast** | Quick processing of simple text documents (applied by default) |
| **Hi-Res** | Complex layouts and mixed content with OCR |
| **Hi-Res FT** | Specialized document types requiring highest accuracy |
| **MAI** | Manuscript and handwritten documents |
| **Graphor** | Complex layouts, multi-page tables, diagrams, and images with rich annotations |

To apply a different parsing method:

1. Click on a processed file from the Sources list to access Source details
2. Review the extracted content in the **Results** tab
3. Select a different **parsing method** from the **Settings** tab
4. Click **Parse** to apply the new method

<img
  className="block border rounded-2xl border-gray-950\/10 ring-2 ring-transparent"
  src="/images/source-parsing-details.png"
  alt="Source parsing details"
  loading="lazy"
/>

The parsing **Results** view shows:
- **Page-by-page preview** of extracted content
- **Element types** identified in each section
- **Markdown output** ready for downstream processing

## Step 4: Extract Structured Data

Transform your documents into structured data using **LLM-powered extraction**. This is perfect for extracting specific information like names, dates, prices, or any custom fields.

1. Select a processed document from Sources to access Source details
2. Navigate to the **Extraction** tab (located at the top center of the page)
3. Add optional **instructions** to guide the extraction
4. Define your output schema by adding fields:
   - **Field name**: The key for extracted data (e.g., `product_name`)
   - **Field type**: Text, Number, Boolean, or Array
   - **Description**: Help the LLM understand what to extract
5. Click **Extract** to run the extraction

**Example for invoice extraction:**

*Instructions:*
> Extract all invoice information from the document. If multiple invoices are present, extract each one as a separate item. Use USD for currency values and convert dates to YYYY-MM-DD format.

*Schema:*

| Field Name | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `invoice_number` | Text | The unique invoice identifier |
| `date` | Text | Invoice date in YYYY-MM-DD format |
| `total_amount` | Number | Total amount due in USD |
| `line_items` | Text | List of products/services with quantities and prices |

<img
  className="block border rounded-2xl border-gray-950\/10 ring-2 ring-transparent"
  src="/images/source-extraction-details.png"
  alt="Source extraction details"
  loading="lazy"
/>

The extraction **Results** view shows:
- **Extracted data table** with all items found in your document
- **Page references** indicating which pages each piece of data came from
- **Export options** to download results as JSON or CSV

## Step 5: Chat with Your Documents

Once your data is ingested, you can immediately start asking questions using the **Document Chat** feature. Graphor provides two chat options:

### Chat with All Sources

On the **Sources** page, click the **Chat** button in the top-right corner to chat with all your ingested documents at once. This is useful when you want to:
- Search across your entire knowledge base
- Find information without knowing which document contains it
- Compare information from multiple sources

### Chat with a Specific Document

On the **Source details** page (after clicking on a specific file), click the **Chat** button in the top-right corner to chat only with that document. This is useful when you want to:
- Focus your questions on a single document
- Avoid noise from other sources
- Deep-dive into a specific file's content

<img
  className="block border rounded-2xl border-gray-950\/10 ring-2 ring-transparent"
  src="/images/chat-details.png"
  alt="Source extraction details"
  loading="lazy"
/>

---

**Example questions:**
- "What are the main topics covered in this document?"
- "Summarize the key findings from the report"
- "What is the total revenue mentioned?"

The chat maintains **conversational memory**, so you can ask follow-up questions without losing context:

> **You:** What products are mentioned in the catalog?
> 
> **Sources:** The catalog mentions Product A, Product B, and Product C...
> 
> **You:** Which one has the highest price?
> 
> **Sources:** Based on the catalog, Product B has the highest price at $299...
