description: 'Give AI coding agents deep Graphor expertise with the Graphor Skills plugin for Claude Code and 27+ agent tools'
---

**Graphor Skills** is a plugin that gives AI coding agents — such as Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, and more — deep domain expertise for working with Graphor. It bundles **MCP server connectivity** and **SDK coding knowledge** so your agent can upload, process, and query documents through natural language.

    **MCP Server config** — auto-configures the `graphor-mcp` server for direct API access.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

The plugin follows the [Agent Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/agent-skills) open standard. When installed, the skills provide your agent with:

1. **Contextual knowledge** — The agent learns Graphor's core workflow (upload, process, query), API patterns, and best practices automatically.
2. **MCP server access** — The bundled `.mcp.json` configuration connects the agent to the Graphor MCP Server, giving it direct access to the API.
3. **SDK coding assistance** — When writing code that uses the Graphor SDK, the agent gets language-specific patterns, method signatures, error handling, and type safety guidance.

<Note>
  Skills activate automatically based on context — you don't need to explicitly load them. The workflow skill activates when you mention Graphor documents, and the SDK skills activate when writing code that imports `graphor`.
</Note>

## Installation

### Claude Code — Plugin Marketplace (Recommended)

The quickest way to install:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add synapseops/graphor-skills
/plugin install graphor@graphor-skills
```

Set your API key when prompted:

```bash
export GRAPHOR_API_KEY="grlm_your_api_key_here"
```

<Warning>
  Add the export to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent so it persists across sessions.
</Warning>

### Project-Level Installation (Team-Wide)

Copy the skills into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory so the entire team benefits:

```bash
cp -r plugin/skills/* your-project/.claude/skills/
```

### Personal Installation (All Projects)

Copy the skills to your personal Claude directory:

```bash
cp -r plugin/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Other Agent Tools

Since the skills follow the Agent Skills open standard, they are portable across **27+ agent tools** including:

- Claude Code
- Cursor
- VS Code
- GitHub Copilot
- Gemini CLI
- And more

Consult your agent tool's documentation for how to install Agent Skills plugins.

## Skills Reference

### graphor-workflow

The primary skill. It teaches the agent the complete Graphor workflow and activates automatically when you mention document operations.

**Activation**: Auto-activates when the agent detects tasks related to uploading, processing, or querying documents in Graphor.

**Core workflow**:

```
Upload → Process → Query
```

The skill enforces the three-step workflow:

1. **Upload** a source — returns status `"New"`
2. **Process** the source by calling parse — triggers async processing (`"New"` → `"Processing"` → `"Completed"`)
3. **Query** the source (ask, extract, or retrieve chunks) — only works after status is `"Completed"`

<Warning>
  Upload alone does **not** start processing. You must explicitly call parse after upload.
</Warning>

**Included rules**:

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `upload-sources` | Upload files, URLs, GitHub repos, or YouTube videos |
| `async-processing` | Process documents and poll for completion status |
| `ask-sources` | Ask questions about documents with conversational Q&A |
| `extraction` | Extract structured data using JSON Schema |
| `retrieve-chunks` | Retrieve chunks for custom RAG pipelines |
| `manage-sources` | List, inspect, or delete documents |

**Universal rules the agent follows**:

1. Uses MCP tools for all non-upload operations (parse, ask, extract, list, delete)
2. Uses `file_ids` over `file_names` (deprecated) — stores `file_id` from upload responses
3. Always processes after upload
4. Always checks status is `"Completed"` before querying

### graphor-ts-sdk

Background knowledge skill for writing TypeScript/JavaScript code with the Graphor SDK.

**Activation**: Activates when writing TypeScript/JavaScript code that imports or uses the `graphor` npm package.

**Covers**:
- Client setup and initialization
- All SDK methods (`upload`, `uploadURL`, `uploadGitHub`, `uploadYoutube`, `parse`, `list`, `delete`, `loadElements`, `ask`, `extract`, `retrieveChunks`)
- File upload patterns (`fs.createReadStream`, `toFile` helper)
- Error handling (`Graphor.BadRequestError`, `Graphor.NotFoundError`, etc.)
- Type safety and TypeScript interfaces

### graphor-py-sdk

Background knowledge skill for writing Python code with the Graphor SDK.

**Activation**: Activates when writing Python code that imports or uses the `graphor` PyPI package.

**Covers**:
- Sync (`Graphor`) and async (`AsyncGraphor`) clients
- All SDK methods (`upload`, `upload_url`, `upload_github`, `upload_youtube`, `parse`, `list`, `delete`, `load_elements`, `ask`, `extract`, `retrieve_chunks`)
- File upload patterns (`Path`, bytes, tuples)
- Error handling (`graphor.BadRequestError`, `graphor.NotFoundError`, etc.)
- Configuration (retries, timeouts, aiohttp)

## Authentication

All skills require a valid Graphor API key. Set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export GRAPHOR_API_KEY="grlm_your_api_key_here"
```

The bundled `.mcp.json` uses `${GRAPHOR_API_KEY}` expansion to read this value automatically.

<Note>
  If MCP operations return authentication errors, the key is not set correctly. Run `export GRAPHOR_API_KEY="grlm_..."` and restart your agent tool.
</Note>

<Note>
  Learn how to create and manage API tokens in the [API Tokens guide](/guides/api-tokens).
</Note>

## Example Usage

Once installed, just talk to your agent naturally:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="arrow-up-from-bracket" title="Upload and summarize a document">
    **You say**: *"Upload https://example.com/report to Graphor and summarize it"*
    
    **Agent will**:
    1. Upload the URL via MCP
    2. Call parse to start processing
    3. Poll until status is `"Completed"`
    4. Ask the document for a summary
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="table" title="Extract structured data">
    **You say**: *"Extract all invoice numbers and amounts from invoice.pdf in Graphor"*
    
    **Agent will**:
    1. Look up the file in your project
    2. Use the extract method with a JSON Schema
    3. Return structured data
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Write SDK code">
    **You say**: *"Write a Python script that uploads all PDFs in a folder to Graphor and extracts their titles"*
    
    **Agent will**:
    1. Activate the `graphor-py-sdk` skill
    2. Write idiomatic Python using `Graphor()`, `upload()`, `parse()`, and `extract()`
    3. Include proper error handling and async processing
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="magnifying-glass" title="Build a RAG pipeline">
    **You say**: *"Retrieve the most relevant chunks about payment terms from my contract"*
    
    **Agent will**:
    1. Use `retrieveChunks` via MCP
    2. Return chunks with file names, page numbers, and relevance scores
  </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Authentication errors from MCP">
    **Causes**: `GRAPHOR_API_KEY` environment variable not set or incorrect
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Run `export GRAPHOR_API_KEY="grlm_your_api_key_here"` in your terminal
    - Add it to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for persistence
    - Restart your agent tool after setting the variable
    - Verify the key starts with `grlm_`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="plug" title="MCP server not connecting">
    **Causes**: Node.js not installed, npx not available, or plugin not installed correctly
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify Node.js 20+ is installed: `node --version`
    - Re-install the plugin: `/plugin install graphor@graphor-skills`
    - Check that `.mcp.json` exists in the plugin directory
    - Try running the MCP server manually: `npx -y graphor-mcp`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="file-circle-xmark" title="Local file uploads failing">
    **Causes**: The MCP server sandbox cannot access local files
    
    **Solutions**:
    - The workflow skill automatically uses `curl` via Bash for local file uploads
    - For URL, GitHub, and YouTube uploads, MCP tools work directly
    - Ensure your `GRAPHOR_API_KEY` is available in the shell environment
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="robot" title="Agent not using Graphor skills">
    **Causes**: Skills not installed or not activated
    
    **Solutions**:
    - Verify installation: `/plugin list` should show `graphor`
    - Be explicit in your prompt: mention "Graphor" or "documents"
    - Check that skill files exist in `.claude/skills/` or the plugin directory
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
